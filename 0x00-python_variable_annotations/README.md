## Introduction
Variable annotations were introduced in Python 3.6 to provide a way to associate type information with variables. This project aims to demonstrate how to use these annotations effectively.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the syntax and purpose of variable annotations.
- Use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Apply variable annotations in functions, classes, and modules.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
